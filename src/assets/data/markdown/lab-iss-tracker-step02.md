# Layout and Style

Our application looks a lot like what we want for the ISS tracker in that it has three tabs, but the UI is a little drab, the pages do not have the correct names, and the icons are wrong. Let's fix that.

In this step, we will:

- Make a simple change to the style
- Update the icons used for the tabs
- Rename the tabs
- Rename the pages in code
