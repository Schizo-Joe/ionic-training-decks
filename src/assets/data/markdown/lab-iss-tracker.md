# Lab: International Space Station Tracker

The purpose of this lab is to introduce you to the Ionic CLI, the Ionic Framework, and the basic structure of an Ionic application. This lab's repo contains tags for each step. To use the repo to walk through the lab:

- `git checkout tags/step1`
- in a separate project, follow the instructions for the step (instructions are in reverse order, so current instructions are always at the top)
- `git checkout tabs/step2`
- compare your results to the results in this repo
- repeat until you run out of steps

By the end of this lab, you should be able to:

- create a new Ionic application
- modify existing pages
- add new services
- add and deploy to mobile platforms
- add and use new Cordova plugins
